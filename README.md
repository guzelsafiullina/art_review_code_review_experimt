# Code review and Art review tasks
This repository contains code review and art review tasks that were offered to participants in an experiment to collect data on brain activity using EEG during the execution of these tasks.

Repository organised as follows:

- art_review folder contains 12 art review tasks. During the experiment, the participant had to look at one picture. Each picture is labeled with several numbers. As an answer to each task, the participant presented a list of numbers that corresponded to the regions that the participant considered incorrect.

- code_review folder contains a table that contains links to codeforce submissions with incorrectly working code, as well as a link to the corrected version of the code. During the execution of the code review, the participant had to pass the review code according to the piece of code given to him and find the places that need to be corrected
